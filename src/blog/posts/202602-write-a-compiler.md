# Write a Compiler (with David Beazley)

Every year I tend to take a course somewhere &mdash; the topics are quite diverse,
ranging from applied math to psychology (it's fun and helps me stay sharp). Normally I
choose something in Stanford or MIT but this year I stumbled upon the [Write a
Compiler](https://dabeaz.com/compiler.html) course by David Beazley and I couldn't
resist. I must say, a week is a long enough period to show you what you are made of ...

It was intense &mdash; even though I ended up using Python[^1] to complete the projects! 

The course hours were between 9:30am and 5:30pm US Central Time/Chicago, while I was
taking it from France (so, between 4:30pm and 12:30am local time for me). As I suspected
what would happen, I kicked my kids out for a week (there are many advantages of being
divorced). I guess a "bachelor coding week" is a good description of what happened
&mdash; it took me 16 hours of coding a day to keep up with the pace (and I am veeery
comfortable with Python, tree recursion etc.)! Coming to think of it, I might have
forgotten to take a shower during the course.

## A typical day 

I start coding around 7am (local time in France), a quick lunch, continue coding until
3pm, take a nap for an hour or so, then join Zoom and of we go, super engaging
discussions (geeky comments and ideas). Around 8pm there is a break and I have dinner (I
take my time to prepare something nice). We continue working and around 10pm I start
losing steam. I mostly listen to the discussion and go to sleep. The next day I catch-up
in the morning (when I am fresh) ...

## The end result

I was able to have a working compiler for the Wab language by the end of day four and
started working on Wabbi. Now I plan to repeat the process using Rust and then look into
Wabbit and types.

This was such a treat! The course was organized flawlessly (I must admit that I have
stolen some ideas for my courses). I really enjoyed the challenge and learned many
things. **Having independent educators like this is a gift**.

Thanks Dave!
