# Welcome to my page!

I am the Founder & CEO of [Manabiya](https://www.manabiya.fr) &mdash; an education
center for software engineering, mathematical optimization and their applications. Why
not stop by and join one of our [open-door events](https://www.manabiya.fr/workshops)
&mdash; let’s explore ideas and work on a hobby-project together.

I am a Co-founder & active member of [Peshachko](https://www.peshachko.bg) &mdash; a
Bulgarian non-governmental organization that promotes walking as a simple way to stay
healthy and create more vibrant, people-friendly cities.

I am also a proud father of two teenage daughters, that don't listen to a word I say :)

I have worked as a senior data scientist at [Kelkoo](https://www.kelkoogroup.com)
(France) and a data scientist/software engineer at
[ProbaYes](http://www.probayes.com/en) (France). I obtained a Ph. D. degree in 2006 from
[Tohoku University](http://www.astro.mech.tohoku.ac.jp) (Japan) and a M. Sc. diploma in
1999 from the [Technical University-Sofia](http://fa.tu-sofia.bg) (Bulgaria). I have
been a research scientist at [INRIA](http://www.inrialpes.fr/bipop/index.html) -
Grenoble (France), and a research scientist / lecturer at
[AASS](https://www.oru.se/english/research/research-environments/ent/aass/) Örebro
University (Sweden).
