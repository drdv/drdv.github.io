# Welcome to my page!

I have worked as a senior data scientist at [Kelkoo](https://www.kelkoogroup.com)
(France) and a data scientist/software engineer at
[ProbaYes](http://www.probayes.com/en) (France). I obtained a Ph. D. degree in 2006 from
[Tohoku University](http://www.astro.mech.tohoku.ac.jp) (Japan) and a M. Sc. diploma in
1999 from the [Technical University-Sofia](http://fa.tu-sofia.bg) (Bulgaria). I have
been a research scientist at [INRIA](http://www.inrialpes.fr/bipop/index.html) -
Grenoble (France), and a research scientist / lecturer at
[AASS](https://www.oru.se/english/research/research-environments/ent/aass/) Örebro
University (Sweden). I am passionate about programming and finding new applications of
mathematical optimization and machine learning.

## Teaching

I was responsible for a number of
[courses/seminars](http://www.aass.oru.se/Research/Learning/drdv.html) during my
5 year stay at Örebro University.
