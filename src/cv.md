# Curriculum vitae

![me](img/me.jpg){ width="200" }

I was born in Sofia, Bulgaria (20.11.1975)

=== "Overview"

	!!! note inline ""

        Consistently managing multiple projects with tight deadlines comes naturally.

	!!! note inline "Scientific research"

		I specialize in optimization, real-time optimal control, and dynamic simulation, with
		more than 20 years of modeling experience spanning robotics, economic systems, online
		bidding, missile navigation, automated vehicles, nuclear reactor instrumentation safety,
		satellite systems etc. I have a strong background in machine learning and advanced data analysis.
	    I am very skilled at problem abstraction, documentation and presentation.

	!!! note "Software development"

		I am an experienced software developer with a strong background in **Python** and
		**C++**. I have a good working knowledge across a wide range of programming languages,
		including **Scala/Spark** (for large-scale data processing), **Rust**, **Racket**,
		**Emacs lisp** and several domain-specific languages such as **Matlab**. I have a solid
		foundation in algorithms and data structures, with a focus on building efficient,
		maintainable, and scalable systems. I’m most effective in Linux-based environments,
		building and maintaining development infrastructure, version control workflows and CI pipelines.
